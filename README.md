# Get Next Line - Read Files, One Line at a Time

**Get Next Line** (`get_next_line`) is a custom C function that allows reading a file descriptor one line at a time, making file handling more efficient and structured.

## ðŸ”§ Features

**Handles multiple format specifiers:**

- **Line-by-line reading** - Reads a file descriptor and returns one line per function call.
- **Efficient memory management** - Uses a dynamic buffer to minimize unnecessary reads.
- **Works with different input sources** - Reads from files and standard input (stdin).
- **Bonus: Multi-FD support** - Can read from multiple file descriptors simultaneously.

## âš¡ How It Works

Each call to `get_next_line(fd)` reads the next available line from the given file descriptor (`fd`). It dynamically manages previously read content to ensure seamless line extraction without unnecessary re-reads.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why It's Useful

`get_next_line` provides an intuitive way to retrieve lines without having to manage buffers manually. It is useful especially when handling large files.
Plus, it introduces concepts like static variables and efficient memory allocation.
